After spending a solid 20-30 hours I figured out how to implement next auth with role based access control in the T3 stack. The boilerplate set up with T3 app (https://create.t3.gg/) is nice but there is a major lack of clarity in the docs (T3, NextAuth, and NextJS) regarding how to properly set this up. This repo was my solution at getting role based access control set up using github as a provider.
